        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Documentation: http://icrawler.readthedocs.io/
        
        This package is a mini framework of web crawlers. With modularization design,
        it can be extended conveniently. It supports media data like images and videos
        very well, and can also be applied to texts and other type of files.
        Scrapy is heavy and powerful, while icrawler is tiny and flexible.
        
        With this package, you can write a multiple thread crawler easily by
        focusing on the contents you want to crawl, avoiding some troublesome problems like
        exception handling, thread scheduling and communication.
        
        It also provides built-in crawlers for popular image sites like flickr and
        search engines such as Google, Bing and Baidu. If you want to add your own
        crawlers into built-in, welcome for pull requests.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7+ or 3.4+ (recommended).
        
        Samples
        -------
        
        Using builtin crawlers is very simple.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from icrawler.builtin import GoogleImageCrawler
        
            google_crawler = GoogleImageCrawler(parser_threads=2, downloader_threads=4,
                                                storage={'root_dir': 'your_image_dir'})
            google_crawler.crawl(keyword='sunny', max_num=1000,
                                 date_min=None, date_max=None,
                                 min_size=(200,200), max_size=None)
        
        Writing your own crawlers with this framework is also convenient, see the
        `tutorials <http://icrawler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#write-your-own>`_.
        
        Structure
        ---------
        
        A crawler consists of 3 main components (Feeder, Parser and Downloader),
        they are connected with each other with FIFO queues. The workflow is shown in
        the following figure.

        -  ``url_queue`` stores the url of pages which may contain images
        -  ``task_queue`` stores the image url as well as any meta data you
           like, each element in the queue is a dictionary and must contain the
           field ``img_url``
        -  Feeder puts page urls to ``url_queue``
        -  Parser requests and parses the page, then extracts the image urls and
           puts them into ``task_queue``
        -  Downloader gets tasks from ``task_queue`` and requests the images,
           then saves them in the given path.
        
        Feeder, parser and downloader are all thread pools, so you can specify the
        number of threads they use.
